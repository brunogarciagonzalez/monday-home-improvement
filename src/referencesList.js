        <p>Dear Marcos,</p>

        <p>
          Thank you for the excellent remodeling that you and your workers did
          on my condominium unit at Montebello. I especially appreciated your
          attention to detail, and quality workmanship, and perhaps most
          importantly, your willingness to work with me in planning and design.
        </p>

        <p>
          Many friends and relatives have admired the finished result, but to
          me, the most important attribute is how comfortable and livable my
          "new" home has become.
        </p>

        <p>
          Please do not hesitate using me as a reference, and again thank you.
        </p>

        <p>

          When I was looking for someone to redo the old and neglected bathroom
          at my condo, one of the ladies in the office said hire Marcos and she
          handed me his card. We conferred for a while to plan the work to be
          done and when I finally found the sink console I liked for a price I
          could afford, we went to work with finalizing the plan.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Marcos came in on budget and on time. I had been told the job would
          take 3-4 weeks and cost about 13-14 thousand dollars for what I
          wanted. There would be delays, I was warned by others but actually,
          because I have just one bath, he finished as he promised and it is
          beautiful.
        </p>

          His work is outstanding, creative, timely and very competitive for the
          value he offers. He is also very gentlemanly and each day before he
          left, he cleaned up so my life could go on being normal. I hired him
          to do other work here and I am just as pleased with every effort he
          made to make my 1986 condo a classic in style, quality and comfort.
        </p>

          My wife an I have known Marcos G. Bebeacua for 3 years. We needed to
          have our condo redecorated in order to make it handicapped accessible
          for my wife. The job included tearing out two bathrooms, the entire
          kitchen, all closets and replacing the tile floor in over half of the
          condo.
        </p>
        <p>
          Marcos made sure we were happy with each phase of the job. He worked
          his schedule to suit our medical needs and made sure all handicap
          accommodations met code. The decisions he made when redesigning our
          home resulted in a high quality product leaving us very proud we chose
          him for the job.
        </p>
        <p>
          Marcos proved to be a man of dedication, integrity and reliability.
        </p>
        <p>We highly recommend Marcos for any type of home improvements.</p>
        <p>
          Sincerely,<br />
